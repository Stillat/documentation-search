Documentation Search is a powerful search provider for Statamic. Documentation Search was developed with documentation-heavy websites in mind, and supports the following features:

1. Split larger entries into smaller sections that can be indexed independently
2. Customizable indexer content, built using either Antlers or Blade templates
3. A custom `documentation:results` Antlers tag, providing advanced features designed to work directly with the search provider
4. Advanced indexer transformers, allowing for customizations of both indexed content *and* user search queries. Perfect for implementing "close enough" searches, or supporting common misspellings.
